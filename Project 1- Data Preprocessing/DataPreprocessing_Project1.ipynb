    "- We used median values of the columns 'days_employed' and 'total_income' to replace missing values respectively. Mean,median and mode are the appropriate ways to replace missing values and measure central tendency of data. In our case, there are several large values of data points which act as outliers in 'days_employed' and 'total_income' columns. For example, 'days_employed' value range from 139.53 to 401755.40. Hence, it is not recommended to use mean for replacing the missing values. Instead, we used median imputation. When data is skewed, it is good to consider using median value. \n",

It's probably because the car loan tends to have lesser restriction to borrow money. It is also possible that there is unknown maintenance cost for the car.
