# Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting
## Project description
Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.
Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Instructions for completing the project
### Step 1. Open the data file /datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv and have a look at the general information.
### Step 2. Preprocess the data:
- Identify and fill in missing values
- Replace the real number data type with the integer type
- Delete duplicate data
- Categorize the data

## Step 3 Answer these questions:

- Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
- How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

## Step 4 Write an overall conclusion.
