##### Put all of your files (including additional files as need â€” just make sure total size is no more than 9 megabytes) in a ZIP archive and submit it for review.
### You'll receive an archive in return, with the reviewer's comments inside each file.
The archive must contain the following:
 - A file containing the data uploaded to the dashboard (name it trending_by_time.csv)
 - A link to the dashboard on Tableau Public's server
 - A presentation file (PDF)
